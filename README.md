## Overview
This repository contains functions and outputs for project 2 of course applied data analysis and machine learning.

## Files and Directories

The primary functions to perform analysis are included in the file src/project_2_utils.py

A class for doing deep learning with a feed forward neural network is contained in the file src/neural_net.py

An initial, simple analysis on polynomial function can be ran by excecuting the script src/simple_1d.py, and a more flexible testing can be done by running the file src/main_test.py. This latter file also includes application on a classification data set.

## Installation

The repository uses a set of library functions from different open sources, including

* sklearn
* seaborn
* autograd
* pandas

Any compatible set of versions should work, but your milage may vary.
